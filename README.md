# RascalSmellDetector

Part of master's project involving Code Smell detection on Python and Java source code.

## Using the detector

The detector can be used in multiple ways. Either with projects directly in Eclipse or from a directory. 

`detectproject(loc project);` detects a single project
`main(loc directory);` walks through all subdirectories and detects smells in each project.
